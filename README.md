# FindLuigitale
this is my attempt at making the cool luigi flowey game in Lua instead of Rust, because im a stupid idiot that doesn't know a damn thing about Rust
SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL PROJECT PLEASE ITS FAR LESS JANKY THAN THIS
original: https://github.com/i-winxd/luigi_flowey

also ill probably be experimenting a ton with this, so the levels will probably be pretty messy
